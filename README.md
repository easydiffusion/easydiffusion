</p>

**Hardware requirements:**
- **Windows:** NVIDIA graphics card¬π (minimum 2 GB RAM), or run on your CPU.
- **Linux:** NVIDIA¬π or AMD¬≤ graphics card (minimum 2 GB RAM), or run on your CPU.
- **Mac:** M1 or M2, or run on your CPU.
- Minimum 8 GB of system RAM.
- Atleast 25 GB of space on the hard disk.

¬π) [CUDA Compute capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported) level of 3.7 or higher required.

¬≤) ROCm 5.2 support required.

The installer will take care of whatever is needed. If you face any problems, you can join the friendly [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB) and ask for assistance.

## On Windows:
1. Run the downloaded `Easy-Diffusion-Windows.exe` file.
2. Run `Easy Diffusion` once the installation finishes. You can also start from your Start Menu, or from your desktop (if you created a shortcut).

If Windows SmartScreen prevents you from running the program click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

**Tip:** On Windows 10, please install at the top level in your drive, e.g. `C:\EasyDiffusion` or `D:\EasyDiffusion`. This will avoid a common problem with Windows 10 (file path length limits).

## On Linux/Mac:
1. Unzip/extract the folder `easy-diffusion` which should be in your downloads folder, unless you changed your default downloads destination.
2. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the `easy-diffusion` directory.
3. Run `./start.sh` (or `bash start.sh`) in a terminal.

# To remove/uninstall:
Just delete the `EasyDiffusion` folder to uninstall all the downloaded packages.

# Easy for new users, powerful features for advanced users
## Features:

### User experience
- **Hassle-free installation**: Does not require technical knowledge, does not require pre-installed software. Just download and run!
- **Clutter-free UI**: A friendly and simple UI, while providing a lot of powerful features.
- **Task Queue**: Queue up all your ideas, without waiting for the current task to finish.
- **Intelligent Model Detection**: Automatically figures out the YAML config file to use for the chosen model (via a models database).
- **Live Preview**: See the image as the AI is drawing it.
- **Image Modifiers**: A library of *modifier tags* like *"Realistic"*, *"Pencil Sketch"*, *"ArtStation"* etc. Experiment with various styles quickly.
- **Multiple Prompts File**: Queue multiple prompts by entering one prompt per line, or by running a text file.
- **Save generated images to disk**: Save your images to your PC!
- **UI Themes**: Customize the program to your liking.
- **Searchable models dropdown**: organize your models into sub-folders, and search through them in the UI.

### Powerful image generation
- **Supports**: "*Text to Image*", "*Image to Image*" and "*InPainting*"
- **ControlNet**: For advanced control over the image, e.g. by setting the pose or drawing the outline for the AI to fill in.
- **16 Samplers**: `PLMS`, `DDIM`, `DEIS`, `Heun`, `Euler`, `Euler Ancestral`, `DPM2`, `DPM2 Ancestral`, `LMS`, `DPM Solver`, `DPM++ 2s Ancestral`, `DPM++ 2m`, `DPM++ 2m SDE`, `DPM++ SDE`, `DDPM`, `UniPC`.
- **Stable Diffusion XL and 2.1**: Generate higher-quality images using the latest Stable Diffusion XL models.
- **Textual Inversion Embeddings**: For guiding the AI strongly towards a particular concept.
- **Simple Drawing Tool**: Draw basic images to guide the AI, without needing an external drawing program.
- **Face Correction (GFPGAN)**
- **Upscaling (RealESRGAN)**
- **Loopback**: Use the output image as the input image for the next image task.
- **Negative Prompt**: Specify aspects of the image to *remove*.
- **Attention/Emphasis**: `+` in the prompt increases the model's attention to enclosed words, and `-` decreases it. E.g. `apple++ falling from a tree`.
- **Weighted Prompts**: Use weights for specific words in your prompt to change their importance, e.g. `(red)2.4 (dragon)1.2`.
- **Prompt Matrix**: Quickly create multiple variations of your prompt, e.g. `a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse | illustration | cinematic lighting`.
- **Prompt Set**: Quickly create multiple variations of your prompt, e.g. `a photograph of an astronaut on the {moon,earth}`
- **1-click Upscale/Face Correction**: Upscale or correct an image after it has been generated.
- **Make Similar Images**: Click to generate multiple variations of a generated image.
- **NSFW Setting**: A setting in the UI to control *NSFW content*.
- **JPEG/PNG/WEBP output**: Multiple file formats.

### Advanced features
- **Custom Models**: Use your own `.ckpt` or `.safetensors` file, by placing it inside the `models/stable-diffusion` folder!
- **Stable Diffusion XL and 2.1 support**
- **Merge Models**
- **Use custom VAE models**
- **Textual Inversion Embeddings**
- **ControlNet**
- **Use custom GFPGAN models**
- **UI Plugins**: Choose from a growing list of [community-generated UI plugins](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/UI-Plugins), or write your own plugin to add features to the project!

### Performance and security
- **Fast**: Creates a 512x512 image with euler_a in 5 seconds, on an NVIDIA 3060 12GB.
- **Low Memory Usage**: Create 512x512 images with less than 2 GB of GPU RAM, and 768x768 images with less than 3 GB of GPU RAM!
- **Use CPU setting**: If you don't have a compatible graphics card, but still want to run it on your CPU.
- **Multi-GPU support**: Automatically spreads your tasks across multiple GPUs (if available), for faster performance!
- **Auto scan for malicious models**: Uses picklescan to prevent malicious models.
- **Safetensors support**: Support loading models in the safetensor format, for improved safety.
- **Auto-updater**: Gets you the latest improvements and bug-fixes to a rapidly evolving project.
- **Developer Console**: A developer-mode for those who want to modify their Stable Diffusion code, modify packages, and edit the conda environment.

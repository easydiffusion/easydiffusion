# What's new?

## v3.0
### Major Changes
- **ControlNet** - Full support for ControlNet, with native integration of the common ControlNet models. Just select a control image, then choose the ControlNet filter/model and run. No additional configuration or download necessary. Supports custom ControlNets as well.
- **SDXL** - Full support for SDXL. No configuration necessary, just put the SDXL model in the `models/stable-diffusion` folder.
- **Multiple LoRAs** - Use multiple LoRAs, including SDXL and SD2-compatible LoRAs. Put them in the `models/lora` folder.
- **Embeddings** - Use textual inversion embeddings easily, by putting them in the `models/embeddings` folder and using their names in the prompt (or by clicking the `+ Embeddings` button to select embeddings visually). Thanks @JeLuf.
- **Seamless Tiling** - Generate repeating textures that can be useful for games and other art projects. Works best in 512x512 resolution. Thanks @JeLuf.
- **Inpainting Models** - Full support for inpainting models, including custom inpainting models. No configuration (or yaml files) necessary.
- **Faster than v2.5** - Nearly 40% faster than Easy Diffusion v2.5, and can be even faster if you enable xFormers.
- **Even less VRAM usage** - Less than 2 GB for 512x512 images on 'low' VRAM usage setting (SD 1.5). Can generate large images with SDXL.
- **WebP images** - Supports saving images in the lossless webp format.
- **Undo/Redo in the UI** - Remove tasks or images from the queue easily, and undo the action if you removed anything accidentally. Thanks @JeLuf.
- **Three new samplers, and latent upscaler** - Added `DEIS`, `DDPM` and `DPM++ 2m SDE` as additional samplers. Thanks @ogmaresca and @rbertus2000.
- **Significantly faster 'Upscale' and 'Fix Faces' buttons on the images**
- **Major rewrite of the code** - We've switched to using diffusers under-the-hood, which allows us to release new features faster, and focus on making the UI and installer even easier to use.

## v2.5
### Major Changes
- **Nearly twice as fast** - significantly faster speed of image generation. Code contributions are welcome to make our project even faster: https://github.com/easydiffusion/sdkit/#is-it-fast
- **Mac M1/M2 support** - Experimental support for Mac M1/M2. Thanks @michaelgallacher, @JeLuf and vishae.
- **AMD support for Linux** - Experimental support for AMD GPUs on Linux. Thanks @DianaNites and @JeLuf.
- **Full support for Stable Diffusion 2.1 (including CPU)** - supports loading v1.4 or v2.0 or v2.1 models seamlessly. No need to enable "Test SD2", and no need to add `sd2_` to your SD 2.0 model file names. Works on CPU as well.
- **Memory optimized Stable Diffusion 2.1** - you can now use Stable Diffusion 2.1 models, with the same low VRAM optimizations that we've always had for SD 1.4. Please note, the SD 2.0 and 2.1 models require more GPU and System RAM, as compared to the SD 1.4 and 1.5 models.
- **11 new samplers!** - explore the new samplers, some of which can generate great images in less than 10 inference steps! We've added the Karras and UniPC samplers. Thanks @Schorny for the UniPC samplers.
- **Model Merging** - You can now merge two models (`.ckpt` or `.safetensors`) and output `.ckpt` or `.safetensors` models, optionally in `fp16` precision. Details: https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/Model-Merging . Thanks @JeLuf.
- **Fast loading/unloading of VAEs** - No longer needs to reload the entire Stable Diffusion model, each time you change the VAE
- **Database of known models** - automatically picks the right configuration for known models. E.g. we automatically detect and apply "v" parameterization (required for some SD 2.0 models), and "fp32" attention precision (required for some SD 2.1 models).
- **Color correction for img2img** - an option to preserve the color profile (histogram) of the initial image. This is especially useful if you're getting red-tinted images after inpainting/masking.
- **Three GPU Memory Usage Settings** - `High` (fastest, maximum VRAM usage), `Balanced` (default - almost as fast, significantly lower VRAM usage), `Low` (slowest, very low VRAM usage). The `Low` setting is applied automatically for GPUs with less than 4 GB of VRAM.
- **Find models in sub-folders** - This allows you to organize your models into sub-folders inside `models/stable-diffusion`, instead of keeping them all in a single folder. Thanks @patriceac and @ogmaresca.
- **Custom Modifier Categories** - Ability to create custom modifiers with thumbnails, and custom categories (and hierarchy of categories). Details: https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/Custom-Modifiers . Thanks @ogmaresca.
- **Embed metadata, or save as TXT/JSON** - You can now embed the metadata directly into the images, or save them as text or json files (choose in the Settings tab). Thanks @patriceac.
- **Major rewrite of the code** - Most of the codebase has been reorganized and rewritten, to make it more manageable and easier for new developers to contribute features. We've separated our core engine into a new project called `sdkit`, which allows anyone to easily integrate Stable Diffusion (and related modules like GFPGAN etc) into their programming projects (via a simple `pip install sdkit`): https://github.com/easydiffusion/sdkit/
- **Name change** - Last, and probably the least, the UI is now called "Easy Diffusion". It indicates the focus of this project - an easy way for people to play with Stable Diffusion.

Our focus continues to remain on an easy installation experience, and an easy user-interface. While still remaining pretty powerful, in terms of features and speed.

### Detailed changelog
* 2.5.48 - 1 Aug 2023 - (beta-only) Full support for ControlNets. You can select a control image to guide the AI. You can pick a filter to pre-process the image, and one of the known (or custom) controlnet models.

* 2.5.35 - 3 May 2023 - (beta-only) First round of VRAM Optimizations for the "Test Diffusers" version. This change significantly reduces the amount of VRAM used by the diffusers version during image generation. The VRAM usage is still not equal to the "non-diffusers" version, but more optimizations are coming soon.
* 2.5.34 - 22 Apr 2023 - Don't start the browser in an incognito new profile (on Windows). Thanks @JeLuf.
* 2.5.33 - 21 Apr 2023 - Install PyTorch 2.0 on new installations (on Windows and Linux).
* 2.5.32 - 19 Apr 2023 - Automatically check for black images, and set full-precision if necessary (for attn). This means custom models based on Stable Diffusion v2.1 will just work, without needing special command-line arguments or editing of yaml config files.

* 2.5.16 - 10 Feb 2023 - Allow a server to enforce a fixed directory path to save images. This is useful if the server is exposed to a lot of users. This can be set in the `config.json` file as `force_save_path: "/path/to/fixed/save/dir"`. E.g. `force_save_path: "D:/user_images"`. Thanks @JeLuf.
* 2.5.16 - 10 Feb 2023 - The "Make Images" button now shows the correct amount of images it'll create when using operators like `{}` or `|`. For e.g. if the prompt is `Photo of a {woman, man}`, then the button will say `Make 2 Images`. Thanks @JeLuf.
* 2.5.16 - 10 Feb 2023 - A bunch of UI-related bug fixes. Thanks @patriceac.
* 2.5.15 - 8 Feb 2023 - Allow using 'balanced' VRAM usage mode on GPUs with 4 GB or less of VRAM. This mode used to be called 'Turbo' in the previous version.
* 2.5.14 - 8 Feb 2023 - Fix broken auto-save settings. We renamed `sampler` to `sampler_name`, which caused old settings to fail.

## v2.4
### Major Changes
- **Allow reordering the task queue** (by dragging and dropping tasks). Thanks @madrang
- **Automatic scanning for malicious model files** - using `picklescan`, and support for `safetensor` model format. Thanks @JeLuf
- **Image Editor** - for drawing simple images for guiding the AI. Thanks @mdiller
- **Use pre-trained hypernetworks** - for improving the quality of images. Thanks @C0bra5
- **Support for custom VAE models**. You can place your VAE files in the `models/vae` folder, and refresh the browser page to use them. More info: https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/VAE-Variational-Auto-Encoder
- **Experimental support for multiple GPUs!** It should work automatically. Just open one browser tab per GPU, and spread your tasks across your GPUs. For e.g. open our UI in two browser tabs if you have two GPUs. You can customize which GPUs it should use in the "Settings" tab, otherwise let it automatically pick the best GPUs. Thanks @madrang . More info: https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion/wiki/Run-on-Multiple-GPUs
- **Cleaner UI design** - Show settings and help in new tabs, instead of dropdown popups (which were buggy). Thanks @mdiller
- **Progress bar.** Thanks @mdiller
- **Custom Image Modifiers** - You can now save your custom image modifiers! Your saved modifiers can include special characters like `{}, (), [], |`
- Drag and Drop **text files generated from previously saved images**, and copy settings to clipboard. Thanks @madrang
- Paste settings from clipboard. Thanks @JeLuf
- Bug fixes to reduce the chances of tasks crashing during long multi-hour runs (chrome can put long-running background tabs to sleep). Thanks @JeLuf and @madrang
- **Improved documentation.** Thanks @JeLuf and @jsuelwald
- Improved the codebase for dealing with system settings and UI settings. Thanks @mdiller
- Help instructions next to some setttings, and in the tab
- Show system info in the settings tab
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Enter to start a task
- Configuration to prevent the browser from opening on startup
- Lots of minor bug fixes
- A `What's New?` tab in the UI
- Ask for a confimation before clearing the results pane or stopping a render task. The dialog can be skipped by holding down the shift key while clicking on the button.
- Show the network addresses of the server in the systems setting dialog
- Support loading models in the safetensor format, for improved safety
